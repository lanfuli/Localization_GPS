<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This project began as a simulator for
the DARPA Urban Challenge. This was done by providing modifications
to the Urban Search And Rescue Simulator (USARSIM) on sourceforge.
These modifications have since been incorporated into USARSIM and
thus files from 2007 on this site are obsolete. USARSIM's meaning has
been changed to Unified System for Automation and Robot Simulation.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The control system for Elcano is
designed for compatibility with USARSIM. However, no work has so far
been done to run Elcano control under USARSIM. We would appreciate a
volunteer stepping forward to take on this task. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There are two methods of running Elcano
with the simulator</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">1) Run the code on Arduino boards which
are wired together properly.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">2) Run the code on a PR. This requires
providing top level code to simulate parallel operation of the
microprocessors and simulated interrupts.</P>
